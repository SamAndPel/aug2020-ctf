    <p class="poem">Once more you fools have fallen into my trap!</p>
    <p class="poem">(It's amazing how easily you Cyberists do that)</p>
    <p class="poem">My trap is dangerous, a ocean-deep abyss,</p>
    <p class="poem">Should you wish to escape, you must riddle me this:</p>
    <br>
    <p class="poem">My name is The Riddler, and I've just completed,</p>
    <p class="poem">A puzzle so hard you will surely be defeated.</p>
    <p class="poem">You must search through this system, onto which I have loaded,</p>
    <p class="poem">A number of flags, base sixty-four encoded.</p>

    <p class="poem">Find them all and freedom is yours - however - </p>
    <p class="poem">Should you fail, you'll be trapped here forever!</p>
